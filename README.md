## Project 1: Distance indicator

Build and program a device that detects the distance to an
obstacle and changes the color of a light to indicate
the distance.

If you're using the kit that I put together, you will have
these components:

- Adafruit QtPY: a compact Arduino-compatible microcontroller
- Adafruit VL53L0X: a time-of-flight distance sensor
- A JST SH 4-pin cable
- A USB C cable
